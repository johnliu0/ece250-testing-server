# ECE250 (Winter 2020) Testing Server

Simple server for automatic project test case checking written in Python and Flask. Project source code that the user uploads is temporarily stored on the server environment and is compiled according to a Makefile. The compiled application is ran and tested with numerous test cases.

I am currently running this testing server at http://142.93.152.112/.

The crowdsourced test cases can be found at https://github.com/ece23/ECE250-testCases.

To clone, `git clone --recursive git@github.com:johnliu4/ece250-testing-server.git`.

Additional thanks to:
